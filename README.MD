Creating this web portfolio is challenging for me, coding is not my experties or I'll just say I dont excel in this particular subject.
I always try hard to do and finish my coding stuff but in the process I ended up watching tons of videos and some research about the topic or the assignment


The big challenge I faced in this project is css and javascript, I tried to ask a friend that have some experience in coding to kind of explain and teach me about bootsrap,jquery and some other css stuff and I'm not gonna lie its still hard to understand but I was there to listen and do the work 


While creating this portfolio I learned that a sigle mistake in the code can cause SO MUCH trouble and time, but I guess thats the fun in coding. # jonasszz.github.io
